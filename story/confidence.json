You need to pick one answer (the one on the left or the one on the right), but also pick how confident are you in your answer. There are three levels, from <em>very confident</em> (90% or more), down to <em>pretty cofident</em> (70%-90%) and finally <em>not very confident</em> (50%-70%).</p>\n<p>The goal is to pick these confidence levels carefully so that in the end your accuracy comes to that confidence interval. If you are very confident in each of your answers, than you should have at least nine correct answers out of ten. Accuracy below 90% would be interpreted as being too confident. On the other hand, if you give all of the ten answer in the 50%-70% range and it turns out that you got every answer right, that is a sign that you were not confident enough in your knowledge.</p>\n<div id=\"Challenge\"></div>\n<div class=\"progress\">\n  <div id=\"ProgressBar\" class=\"determinate\" style=\"width: 70%\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>I have enough data to give out an estimate of how accurate were your confidence levels.</p>\n<div class=\"center-align\">\n  <a id=\"FinishBtn\" class=\"waves-effect waves-light btn disabled\">Keep clicking!</a>\n</div>\n<section id=\"Outcome\"></section>","form":"html"}],"headings":[]}
