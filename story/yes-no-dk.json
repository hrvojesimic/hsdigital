So for each group of answers we have three non-negative integers in the dataset:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>⟨c⟩ ⋯ number of correct answers</li>\n  <li>⟨i⟩ ⋯ number of incorrect answers</li>\n  <li>⟨d⟩ ⋯ number of &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; (DK) answers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total number of answers is a positive integer ⟨t = c + i + d⟩.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-triangle-chart\" class=\"section\">The triangle chart</h2>\n<p>We are interested mostly in relative numbers, share of correct and incorrect answers: ⟨c/t⟩ and ⟨i/t⟩. Since ⟨c/t + i/t &lt;= 1⟩, all possible outcomes can be plotted as a point in a triangle. For example, 50% correct answers, 30% incorrect ones and 20% don&#39;t-knows can be depicted like this:</p>\n<div class=\"tchart\" data-palette=\"blues\" data-formula=\"dot\">\n</div>\n<p>Different parts of the triangle have different combinations of ⟨c/t⟩, ⟨i/t⟩ and ⟨d/t⟩ in each point. I&#39;m using here the RGB color model to represent the combination of these three numbers: the green component for correct answers, the red one for incorrect, and the blue for DKs:</p>\n<div class=\"tchart\" data-palette=\"rgb\" data-formula=\"pst\">\n</div>\n<p>How correct is a group of respondants</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s a real-world example of the chart.</p>\n<div id=\"TriangleQ5\" class=\"tchart\" data-palette=\"rgb\" data-formula=\"Q5\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-single-score\" class=\"section\">A single score</h2>\n<p>Eurobarometer is using a single number to sort , ⟨c/t⟩. In the basic numbers of our group, we can define this &quot;correctness&quot; score ⟨s_c⟩ as:</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">⟨ s_c = c/(c + i + d) ⟩</p>\n<p>We can plot this function using our ranging from dark red for zero, going through light yellow for 0.5 and finishing with dark green for the score value of one.</p>\n<div class=\"tchart\" data-palette=\"redgreen\" data-formula=\"sc\">\n</div>\n<p>We can see that the score varies only in the ⟨x⟩ dimension, and the ratio ⟨i : d⟩ makes no difference to the score. This means that respondents who abstained from answering were just as wrong as those convinced that the correct answer was the wrong one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"three-scoring-strategies\" class=\"section\">Three scoring strategies</h2>\n<p>When calculating the score, we need to decide what to do with the DKs. There are three different strategies on what to make of them:</p>\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n  <li>DKs are <em>wrong</em></li>\n  <li>DKs are to be <em>excluded</em> from calculation</li>\n  <li>DKs are <em>half-right</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We just saw the first strategy in action, ⟨s_c⟩. </p>\n<p>The principal problem with ⟨s_c⟩ is that it is sensitive to risk-taking respondents. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"excluding-the-don-t-know-s\" class=\"section\">Excluding the &quot;Don&#39;t know&quot;s</h2>\n<p>Second strategy is to ignore the DKs in our calculations. Now the score is just the share of the correct in all &quot;knowing&quot; answers:</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ s_r = c/(c + i) ⟩\n</p>\n<p>But there is a small problem with this equation, as the score is undefined when all answers are DK, i.e. when ⟨c = i = 0⟩. So we need to explicitly define the value for that singularity. Not that the points along the ⟨y⟩-axis have value of 0, and those along the ⟨x⟩-axis have the value of 1. It makes sense to use the arhythmetic mean of these values, and also the value of all points along the main diagonal: 0.5. So we arrive at this definition for ⟨s_r⟩:</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ s_r = {(c/(c + i), if c+i &gt; 0), (0.5, if c+i = 0):} ⟩\n</p>\n<div class=\"tchart\" data-palette=\"redgreen\" data-formula=\"sr\">\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-half-right-model\" class=\"section\">The half-right model</h2>\n<p>We know ⟨c⟩ were correct, and another ⟨d/2⟩ would be correct if they tossed a coin instead of saying they don&#39;t know.</p>\n<p><p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ s_M = (c + d/2)/(c + i + d) ⟩\n</p}></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-kdg-model\" class=\"section\">The KDG model</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>⟨k⟩ ⋯ people <strong>k</strong>new the correct answer and answered that way</li>\n  <li>⟨d⟩ ⋯ people <strong>d</strong>idn&#39;t know the correct answer and said so</li>\n  <li>⟨g⟩ ⋯ people didn&#39;t know the correct answer, but ventured an unbiased <strong>g</strong>uess</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only incorrect answers in this model are the unlucky half of guessers: ⟨i = g/2⟩, so number of guessers is ⟨2i⟩, while the number of people who knew was ⟨k = c - g/2 = c - i⟩.</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ s_M = k/(k + g + d) = (c - i)/(c + i + d) ⟩\n</p>\n<p>In this model there are at least as many correct answers as incorrect ones (⟨c &gt;= i⟩), which keeps ⟨s_M⟩ values between zero and one. However, when number of incorrect answers exceeds the correct ones, the score goes down all the way to -1. To get it back to the ⟨[0;1]⟩ range, we have to add one and then divide by two:</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ (s_M + 1)/2 = ((c - i)/(c + i + d) + 1)/2 = ((c - i) + (c + i + d))/(2(c + i + d)) = (2c + d)/(2(c + i + d)) = (c + d/2)/(c + i + d) ⟩\n</p>\n<p>But this is the half-right formula!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-kmdg-model\" class=\"section\">The KMDG model</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>⟨k⟩ ⋯ <strong>k</strong>new the correct answer and answered that way</li>\n  <li>⟨m⟩ ⋯ thought they knew the correct answer, but were <strong>m</strong>istaken</li>\n  <li>⟨d⟩ ⋯ <strong>d</strong>idn&#39;t know the correct answer and said so</li>\n  <li>⟨g⟩ ⋯ didn&#39;t know the correct answer, but ventured an unbiased <strong>g</strong>uess</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Count them: <em>four</em> different variables</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ i = m + g/2 ⇒ g = 2(i - m) ⟩<br>\n⟨ c = k + g/2 ⇒ c - k = i - m ⇒ k = c - i + m ⟩<br>\n⟨ s = k/(k + m + d) = (c - i + m)/(c - i + 2m + d) ⟩\n</p>\n<p>In this model, </p>\n<div class=\"tchart\" data-palette=\"redgreen\" data-formula=\"sm\">\n</div>\n<p>⟨A⟩ knew and picked the correct option. ⟨B⟩ didn&#39;t know, so they had 50% chance of guessing the correct option. So the correct answer gave ⟨c = A + B/2⟩ responders, while the incorrect were ⟨i = B/2⟩. Solving this for ⟨A⟩ and ⟨B⟩ gives us ⟨A = c - i⟩ and ⟨B = 2i⟩.</p>\n<p>So the score is:</p>\n<p class=\"center-align\">\n⟨ s_m = A/(A+B) = (c - i)/(c + i + d) ⟩\n</p>\n<table class=\"highlight centered\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>test case</th>\n      <th>⟨s_c⟩</th>\n      <th>⟨s_d⟩</th>\n      <th>⟨s_m⟩</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>all gamblers</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>all abstained</td>\n      <td>0%</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>quarters</td>\n      <td>37.5%</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>","form":"html"}],"headings":[{"id":"the-triangle-chart","title":"The triangle chart"},{"id":"a-single-score","title":"A single score"},{"id":"three-scoring-strategies","title":"Three scoring strategies"},{"id":"excluding-the-don-t-know-s","title":"Excluding the &quot;Don&#39;t know&quot;s"},{"id":"the-half-right-model","title":"The half-right model"},{"id":"the-kdg-model","title":"The KDG model"},{"id":"the-kmdg-model","title":"The KMDG model"}]}
